Stateful testing opens new possibilities for testing.

* Finding memory leaks
* Malfunctions from external logic
    * I/O failures
    * Network errors
    * Out-of-memory errors
* Thread-safety (concurrency testing)
* Testing for Transactional requirements
    * Transactional visibility as invariant property
    * Atomicity of a transaction
